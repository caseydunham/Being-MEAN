  p.
    Modern web applications make frequent use of templates such as Jade (now
    called "Pug") and Jinja2 to embed dynamic content in pages. When this
    dynamic content is provided by an untrustworthy source (i.e. users), it
    can lead to a form of exploitation known as Template Injection.
