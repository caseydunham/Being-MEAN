  h1 Server Side Template Injection Example 1
  p.
    Modern web applications make frequent use of templates such as Jade (now
    called "Pug") and Jinja2 to embed dynamic content in pages. When this
    dynamic content is provided by an untrustworthy source (i.e. users), it
    can lead to a form of exploitation known as Template Injection.
  p.
    The following form is vulnerable to a Server Side Template Injection.
  div
    form(name="preview", method="post")
          div.input
              textarea(cols="80", rows="10", name="tpl")
          div.actions
              input(type="submit", value="Preview")
  p
    //- TODO: Figure out how to properly reroute to index
    a(href="http://localhost:3000") Return to Index
